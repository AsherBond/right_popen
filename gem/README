RightScale::popen3 allows running external processes aynchronously
while still capturing their standard and error outputs.
It relies on EventMachine for most of its internal mechanisms.

The Windows implementation relies on a native C++ module which must
currently be built using the MSVC 6.0 compiler due to a dependency
on the standard libraries FILE struct provided by the "msvcrt.dll".
Some of the C++ code is based on the win32/open3 gem's C implementation.

The gem can be build manually on either Linux or Windows and will produce
separate gem files depending on current platform. You must install the
"rake" gem and then enter "rake build_binary_gem" from the directory
containing the "Rakefile".
